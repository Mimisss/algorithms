Implementation of classic algorithms in Pascal.

Just for the fun of it.

## sorting

### [bubble sort](sorting/BubbleSort.pas)
old, classic bubble sort with two nested for loops. as easy as it gets.

### [shaker sort](sorting/ShakerSort.pas)
a fancy version of bubble sort with two for loops shaking the array until no more can do.

### [selection sort](sorting/SelectionSort.pas)
it selects the item with the least value and swaps it with the first item. Then, again, it selects the next one 
from the rest n-1 items and swaps it with the second item and so forth.

### [insertion sort](sorting/InsertionSort.pas)
nicely sorts the array by picking an item, shifting all other items before it one position to the right and then
inserting it to its proper position. this [graphical example](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/Insertion-sort-example-300px.gif) illustrates.
